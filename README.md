## 🧠 Project Overview

Note Loom is designed to serve **multiple colleges simultaneously** using a multi-tenant architecture. Each college (tenant) is isolated — their students, faculty, data, and features are completely separate from other colleges on the same platform.

The platform has **three user-facing portals**:
- **College Portal** — for Students, Faculty, and College Admins
- **IT Portal** — for Note Loom system administrators (Noteloom Admins & Managers)
- **AI Assistant** — embedded within the college portal, powered by Google Gemini + Cloudflare AI

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy Design

This is the **most critical architectural pattern** in the system.

### How it works:

1. **Tenant** = a College. Each college is a `Tenant` document in MongoDB with a unique `collegeCode` (e.g., `1001`, `1002`).
2. Every user belongs to a college via the **Membership** collection (`userId` + `tenantId` + `role`).
3. Every piece of data (notices, classrooms, batches, library books, exam sessions, etc.) is tagged with a `tenantId` field.
4. When a user logs in, they provide their **college code**. The backend finds the matching tenant and creates a **Session** document linking `userId` + `tenantId`.
5. Every subsequent API request includes this session token. The `setTenantContext` middleware validates it and injects `req.tenant`, `req.user`, and `req.role` into every request — ensuring all database queries are automatically scoped to that college.

### Key Models for Multi-Tenancy:
| Model | Role |
|---|---|
| `Tenant` | Represents a college (name, code, logo, status) |
| `Membership` | Links user ↔ tenant with a role |
| `Session` | Active login session token with expiry |
| `SystemConfig` | Per-tenant feature flag configuration |

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Session System

### Sign-Up Flow
1. User enters email → backend checks if already registered (`/api/auth/check-email`)
2. A 6-digit OTP is generated, stored in `EmailVerification` collection with a 10-minute TTL, and sent via **Nodemailer** (Gmail SMTP)
3. User enters OTP → backend verifies and marks code as used
4. User submits full registration form with college code → backend:
   - Creates `User` document (hashed password via bcrypt)
   - Finds `Tenant` by college code
   - Creates `Membership` record linking user to tenant with role
   - Creates a role-specific **Profile** (StudentProfile / FacultyProfile / AdminProfile)
   - Auto-generates a unique **UID** (format: `{collegeCode}{year}{sequentialNumber}`)

### Sign-In Flow
1. User submits email + password + college code
2. Backend verifies credentials with `bcrypt.compare`
3. Finds the tenant by college code and validates user's membership in that tenant
4. Signs a **JWT** (`{ userId, tenantId, collegeCode }`) with 24-hour expiry
5. Creates a `Session` document in MongoDB storing the token + expiry
6. Returns the `sessionToken` to the frontend, which stores it in `localStorage`

### Request Authentication
Every protected API request sends `Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>`.
The `setTenantContext` middleware:
- Looks up the session token in the `Session` collection (checks expiry)
- Populates `req.user` (id, name, email), `req.tenant` (id, name, code), `req.role`
- Updates `session.lastActivity` timestamp
- Calls `next()` — or returns 401/403 on failure

### IT Portal Authentication
Uses a separate `setITContext` middleware that checks if the membership role is `it_admin` or `it_user`. The frontend role labels (`noteloom_admin`, `noteloom_manager`) are mapped server-side for compatibility.

### Automated Cleanup (Scheduled Tasks)
The server runs two `setInterval` jobs every hour:
- Deletes expired `EmailVerification` records
- Permanently deletes `PhysicalBook` records scheduled for deletion after their 48-hour buffer

---

## 👥 Role System

| Role (DB) | Frontend Label | Access Level |
|---|---|---|
| `student` | Student | College portal — student features |
| `faculty` | Faculty | College portal — faculty features |
| `college_admin` | College Admin | Full college management |
| `it_user` | Noteloom Manager | IT portal — limited access |
| `it_admin` | Noteloom Admin | IT portal — full system control |

Features visible to each role are controlled by `masterFeatures.js` (backend config) and stored per-tenant in `SystemConfig`. The IT Admin can toggle any feature ON/OFF for any college and role via the Feature Manager panel.

---

## 🤖 AI Feature — Deep Dive

The AI system is in `backend/routes/aiRoutes.js`. It uses a **primary + fallback dual-AI strategy**.

### Primary AI: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- Configured via `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- Handles text prompts, multimodal (image, audio, video, PDF)
- Rate limit handling: automatic retry up to 3 times with 4-second delay on 429/503 errors

### Fallback AI: Cloudflare Workers AI
- Configured via `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- Text: `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`
- Vision: `@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct`
- Audio: `@cf/openai/whisper`

---

### Endpoint 1: `POST /api/ai/chat` — AI Study Buddy
Three modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `default` | Friendly assistant ("Noteloom AI") |
| `tutor` | Socratic tutor — asks guiding questions instead of giving answers directly |
| `mindmap` | Generates a Mermaid.js flowchart for any topic |

**Mind Map Flow:**
1. Gemini generates Mermaid.js `graph TD` code
2. Backend sanitizes the code (`cleanMermaidCode()`) — fixes arrow syntax, removes code fences
3. Response is wrapped with `:::MERMAID_Start:::...:::MERMAID_End:::` tags
4. Frontend detects the tags and renders a `<MermaidDiagram />` component

---

### Endpoint 2: `POST /api/ai/summarize-file` — Summarize & Solve
Accepts any file upload (up to 50MB) and summarizes or solves it.

**File Processing Pipeline:**

```
Upload File
    │
    ▼
What type?
    ├── PDF / Image / Audio / Video
    │       └── ATTEMPT 1: Upload to Gemini File API → Wait for PROCESSING state → Generate content
    │               └── FAIL? → ATTEMPT 2: Cloudflare fallback
    │
    └── DOCX / XLSX / PPTX / Text
            └── Extract text locally first:
                    ├── .docx → mammoth (text) → if <50 chars → Tesseract OCR on embedded images
                    ├── .xlsx → ExcelJS
                    ├── .pptx → officeparser
                    └── Send extracted text to Gemini → FAIL? → Cloudflare Llama 3
```

**Scanned Document OCR (for Cloudflare fallback):**
- **Scanned PDF**: Uses `pdf-poppler` to convert each page to PNG → Tesseract.js reads each PNG → merges text. **25-page limit enforced.**
- **Scanned DOCX**: Opens the `.docx` ZIP container, finds `word/media/` images → Tesseract.js reads each. **25-image limit enforced.**
- **Images**: Resize to max 1024×1024px via `sharp` → send to Cloudflare Vision AI → fallback to local Tesseract OCR

---

### Endpoint 3: `POST /api/ai/transcribe-local-video` — Lecture Video AI
Analyzes locally stored classroom video files.

**Strategy:**
```
Video File (from webdata/uploads/classrooms/)
    │
    ▼
STRATEGY A: Upload to Gemini File API
    → Wait for PROCESSING
    → Generate: summary + bullet points of lecture content
    │
    └── FAIL? → STRATEGY B: FFmpeg fallback
            ├── Extract audio track → WAV (mono, 16kHz, via ffmpeg-static)
            ├── Send WAV to Cloudflare Whisper (speech-to-text)
            ├── Empty transcript? → "Silent video" message
            └── Has transcript? → Send to Cloudflare Llama 3 to summarize
```

### Local OCR Service (`services/LocalOCR.js`)
A thin wrapper around **Tesseract.js** that:
- Accepts an image buffer
- Runs English OCR locally (no external API)
- Used as a last-resort fallback when cloud AI is unavailable

---

## 🖥 Frontend Overview

The frontend is a **React SPA** served by Vite. The main file is `src/App.jsx` — a large monolithic component that handles routing and all major page rendering.

### Key Frontend Capabilities:
- **Multi-portal routing** — College portal vs IT portal vs public landing/login pages
- **Session persistence** — `localStorage` for session token; auto-verifies on reload
- **Role-based UI** — Dashboard features toggled based on role + SystemConfig from backend
- **AI Chat Panel** — Floating assistant with chat history, file upload, mindmap rendering
- **PDF Generation** — jsPDF for admit cards, fee receipts, reports
- **QR/Barcode** — Library book cards with QR codes and barcodes
- **Video Player** — react-player for streaming classroom videos
- **In-browser PDF viewer** — react-pdf for document preview
- **Mermaid rendering** — Dynamic mind map diagrams from AI output

## 📋 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| **Session in DB (not stateless JWT only)** | Allows instant session invalidation (logout, suspension) without waiting for JWT expiry |
| **Dual AI strategy (Gemini + Cloudflare)** | Ensures 99%+ uptime for AI features even during Gemini rate limits or outages |
| **Local Tesseract OCR** | Zero-cost fallback for scanned documents; no third-party API dependency |
| **25-page OCR limit** | Prevents memory exhaustion and extreme processing times on the server |
| **Embedded `issuedTo` in PhysicalBook copies** | Avoids expensive joins on every book lookup; snapshot-style data at time of issue |
| **`masterFeatures.js` + `SystemConfig`** | Decouples feature list (code) from feature activation (database), allowing IT to toggle features without code deploys |
| **Incremental college codes (1001, 1002...)** | Predictable, human-readable IDs for college identification instead of random numbers |
| **`setInterval` cleanup jobs** | Prevents database bloat from expired OTPs and soft-deleted records without a separate job scheduler |
